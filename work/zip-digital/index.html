	    <p>In 2014, Indatus was spending a significant amount of time and money supporting Zip Digital; a legacy multi-family mass-notification tool. Instead of continuing to try and patch a sinking ship, we were tasked to recreate an entirely new product to replace it. After months of user research and iterative development, we released our first version on April 1, 2015. A day that will live on foreverâ€”as the day before the President of the United States came to pay us a visit. More on that later.</p>

	    <h4 class="role">Role</h4>

	    <p>I was part of the agile development team responsible for creating the new Zip Digital. I led design and front-end development work, working with a dedicated UX researcher for the first half of the product cycle. When she moved on to a new opportunity, my product owner and I shared those responsibilities.</p>

	    <h3 class="section-header">The Challenge</h3>

	    <p>The users on our legacy product were frustrated. They had been dealing with broken software by creating hacks and work-arounds. The customer base had expanded to other industries outside of multi-family and Zip Digital had become bloated with features that were no longer useful (or working properly). We decided that we needed to strip down the new application to the most basic user needs; focusing on clarity and reliability to gain their trust back and provide a consistent experience.</p>

	    <p>At the same time, the team was trying to manage the expectations of stakeholders. The engineering department was accustomed to running a user-centered, agile approach, but we were still working to get widespread executive support. This meant that we needed to hit the ground running to figure out our users needs, while showing stakeholders the value of an agile workflow.</p>

        <h3 class="section-header">The Process</h3>

        <p>When I came on to the project the engineers already had a working, bootstrapped prototype. Before we went any further I wanted to make sure that we were heading in a direction that made the most sense for our users. As a team, we went through several use cases and ended up with lots of sketches that we turned into clickable prototypes that focused on the most important workflows, such as contact importing and message creation.</p>

        <p>We completed usability testing with 12 participants. Six were legacy Zip Digital users, and six were new to the product. The six legacy users had a variety of use patterns, which helped us discover the varying needs that the product needed to meet. One important take away we learned from testing them in their own environments.</p>

        <blockquote class="pull-quote">"Every single in-person session was interrupted by a person walking into the participants office or calling them on the phone. These are busy people." <cite>Taken from usability report</cite></blockquote>
        
        <p>Our users were working with constant distraction. They needed a tool that they could get in and out of quickly without wondering if their rent reminders went out or not. This helped us zero-in on three areas of focus.</p>

	    <h3>Tackling Contact Management</h3>
	    
	    <p>We had a couple of hurdles to overcome when it came to contact importing and management. We needed users to have the ability to import their contacts into Zip Digital no matter what software or tracking system they were using for keeping up with their residents. Our first thought was to allow users to upload any CSV file and then map the data from their columns so that everything was imported correctly.</p>

    </div>

    <h4>Column Mapping Prototype</h4>

    <img class="" src="/images/ui-prototype.jpg" alt="Column Mapping Prototype">

    <div class="inner-content">

	    <p>This was part of the prototype that we tested with 12 users showing a column-mapping import. The user would upload a file in a drag and drop interface and then match columns from their uploaded list to their Zip Digital list. We showed the first few lines from each column with placeholder data to try and convey an example of what they would see.</p>

	    <p>Most of our users had a lot of trouble completing this task. This could be due to a number of factors; some had a lack of knowledge of spreadsheets or how their property management software worked, and they were seeing unfamiliar, placeholder data. The takeaway was that we learned a lot about user expectations and decided to reevaluate the import process.</p>

	</div>

    <img src="/images/ui-import-modal.jpg" alt="Import Modal">

    <div class="inner-content">

	    <p>After going back to the drawing board with our new knowledge, we decided to use a CSV template that allowed users to copy and paste their contact data in to the appropriate columns. Customers responded better to this option because they felt it gave them more control for how their data was being imported. They could add as many custom columns as they wanted as long as they included: <strong>First Name</strong>, <strong>Last Name</strong>, and <strong>one point of contact</strong>.</p> 

	</div>

    <img src="/images/ui-overall-lists.jpg" alt="Overall Lists">

    <img src="/images/ui-contact-card.jpg" alt="Contact Card">

    <div class="inner-content">

	    <p>They could also create as many lists as they wanted, and each could have different contacts on them to allow them to target their messaging.Once a contact had been uploaded successfully, a user could see all of imported data associated with that contact in one place, as well as any of the messages that had been sent to them.</p>

	    <h3 class="center section-header">Sending Messages With Ease</h3>


	    <p>As mentioned earlier, our users are busy people. Message creation needed to be as simple as possible so they could get them out quickly and reliably. We decided to use clean form fields and I wrote friendly micro copy that would help guide users through creating and sending their messages.</p>

	</div>

    <img src="/images/ui-new-email.jpg" alt="New Email Message">

    <img src="/images/ui-message-view.jpg" alt="Message View">

    <div class="inner-content">

	    <p>Users could choose which list they wanted to send to, give their message an internal name, type it out, and send all on the same view. Once messages were sent, users could see a summary of the message and watch in real-time as it gets sent out to a list of contacts. They could also filter the recipients by their send status.</p>

	    <h3>Friendly Feedback</h3>

	    <p>One of the most important things that users wanted in the new Zip Digital was good feedback. We wanted to reassure a user that things were going smoothly, or if errors came up, how could they be resolved?</p>

	    <p>I made sure that statuses were present in most areas of the app where data was incoming or outgoing and with errors displayed clearly when necessary. I also made them color-coded to provide additional context at a glance.</p>

	    <p>I ensured that all of our messaging had a similar voice and tone. This meant that stripping the old, robotic alert messages for more friendly language. Even if a user was having trouble or dealing with a particular pain point, I wanted the experience to remain an overall positive one.</p>

	    <h3 class="section-header">The Result</h3>

	    <p>Although the launch day of Zip Digital was slightly over shadowed by the presence of Secret Service agents and bomb-sniffing dogs (seriously, thanks Obama) we saw it as a success when we heard from happy customers that the new product was a huge improvement over legacy and saw a drop in customer service calls.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="inner-content">

	    <blockquote class="pull-quote">"After the rebuild of the product we saw a significant drop in customer calls and tickets. Customers were no longer having issues with how to utilize our product. The drop in tickets and customer complaints/problems has allowed us to focus our attention on new projects within our department." <cite>Stefanie Hogan, Customer Care</cite></blockquote>

	    <p>I was proud of the first iteration of the new Zip Digital. Although I wish I had been brought on to the development team earlier, I still was able to take real feedback and put that at the forefront for every design decision, rather than assuming we knew what our users needed. I also got to learn a lot about the agile process and the benefits of iterative design.</p>

	        <h4>Quotes from Beta Program</h4>
	        
	        <blockquote class="column-4 small-quote">"Even without preview, Nicole commented on how easy it was to create and send a voice blast using text-to-speech in New ZD."</blockquote>

	        <blockquote class="column-4 small-quote">"Debbie said she had no problem finding a way to get her spreadsheet to ZD, and said it worked exactly the way she expected it to."</blockquote>

	        <blockquote class="column-4 small-quote">"Janie was able to search her name and contact information, "no problem" in the new ZD. Commented that it was simple to find.</blockquote>

	    </div>

	    <p>There are definitely plenty of areas that could be improved on, especially with the importing process. Customers would have preferred direct integration with their property management software that was unfortunately unfeasible on our end due to extremely high costs. As much as I wish we could solve for every problem, some things are are just out of our control. I still am happy that our users now have a significantly improved experience with our software.</p>
