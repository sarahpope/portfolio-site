            <p>Answer Automation, an answering service that records and monitors emergency maintenance calls , needed to go through some changes. Their accompanying mobile app was being taken out of the interface completely and instead of just removing any trace of it, leaving gaping holes in the product, we saw it as an opportunity to iterate the design on some original features.</p>

            <h4 class="role">Role</h4>

            <p>I was asked to join the Answer Automation team after my work on Zip Digital. I was responsible for the UX design work and the visual design for the call path redesign.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">The Challenge</h3>

            <hr class="divider">

            <p>Answer Automation had an accompanying mobile application called <strong>Mobile Maintenance</strong> that was meant as a tool for maintenance techs and property managers to track their time or take notes when out on a service call.</p>

            <p>It was decided that mobile app portion wasn't being used enough to keep it running, so it needed to be removed from the web app completely. I decided to use this as an opportunity to complete a usability check and see where improvements could be made to the overall experience of the product.</p>

                <hr class="divider">

                <p>The Answer Automation software had been redesigned only a year before I was brought on to the team. It had a clean design and looked great, but I wanted to look over the interface as an outsider and take some notes on the overall workflow. This way we could uncover any usability problems and tackle them while removing the Mobile Maintenance app information.</p>

            <hr class="divider--project">

            <p>As I went through the interface, I took notes on my initial reactions. They are below in blue.</p>

                <!--<figcaption>There were a couple of things here that needed some clarification. There were no visual cues to show the user that these tables opened to show more information other than a hover state. I also didn't realize that the table headers would sort the data if you clicked on them until my product owner told me.</figcaption>-->

                <p class="center">Expanded Call Path</p>

                <!--<figcaption>This is the expanded call path view that shows when you click on a table row. A lot of events happened within the same minute, yet the time was being repeated and taking up visual weight. Also, when I asked the PO what was the most important info the users would be looking for, he listed the original voice message and the response time; two things that had to be accessed with a click.</figcaption>-->
            </figure>

                <p class="center">"Filter" bar</p>

                <!--<figcaption>Lastly, this filter bar was somewhat awkwardly placed at the bottom of the table rows. If you needed to filter your calls, this might be more useful at the top of the table rows before scrolled all the way down. </figcaption>-->

            <h3 class="center">Mapping it Out</h3>

                <hr class="divider--project">

                <p>There was definitely some room for improvement, so as a team we decided to focus on beefing up the overall navigation and improving the usability of the call path tables. We started by going to a white board and listing every piece of information that we would need to display for each call and prioritizing it.</p>
                
                <img src="/images/aa/call-path-mindmap.jpg" alt="Call Path Mind Map">
                

                <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to survey any real users at this point due to timing issues, so my product owner helped prioritize the most important things that users looked for when they logged onto Answer Automation. With this information, I went straight to prototyping.</p>

                    <h4>Clear Navigation</h4>
                    <p>The navigation was changed to give it more visual weight to show its importance on the page. Properties, mailbox types, and time-frame options were now all in dropdown menus and put directly on top of the dashboard to signify what it controlled.</p>

                <div class="feature-desc">
                    <h4>Usable Search</h4>
                    <p>I moved the search bar to the top of the tables, where users would more likely expect to find it, and to save them from scrolling to the bottom of the page. I also removed table headers since they were no longer necessary, but kept the sorting feature as a dropdownâ€”a pattern that would hopefully be more familiar to our users.</p>

                    <p>I moved the audio player out of the call path drawer so that users could listen to their voicemails more easily. I also added a progress bar to provide some context of how long the message is. Before, there was no visual indication for the user.</p>

                    <p>Response time is one of the most important pieces of information that a user is looking for when they access the app. Knowing this, I decided to move it out of the drawer, where it was hard to find to a more prominent place in the table. This way a user could quickly see how fast their maintenance techs were responding to emergency calls.</p>

            <p>The redesign of the Answer Automation was very well-received with users. They were able to find the information they needed more quickly than ever and gave feedback that the experience felt more clear.</p>
