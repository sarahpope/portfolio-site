	<p>Energy peaks are times when utility customers collectively use the most energy, such as a hot July day between 2pm and 6pm. These peak times strain the electrical grid and utilities were having to pay premium rates to cover the demand and passing those costs to their customers.</p>

  <p>With a BYOD program, utilities could use smart devices homeowner already owned to move energy back onto the grid and help minimize energy peaks. In exchange, homeowners would receive a credit on their energy bill. </p>

	<h4>The design goals for the BYOD program were:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Allow homeowners to easily enroll their IoT devices in the program no matter the screen they were using.</li>
    <li>Create a flexible design that would look good with any utility branding applied.</li>
  </ul>

	<strong>Full case study to come.</strong>
