		<p><strong>Role:</strong> Product Designer</p>
		<p><strong>Company:</strong> Hireology</p>
		<p><strong>Launched:</strong> May 2017 - May 2018</p>
		
	</div>

	<h2>The Challenge</h2>

	<p>Hireology’s exisiting reporting tool wasn’t providing enough value to our customers. It suffered low usage, and yet customers were requesting custom reports every month from their support specialists.</p>

	<p>Through our discovery research process, we learned that an overflowing dashboard of every single metric we track would have the same fate. Our users didn’t have time to sort through a large quantity of data, but they all had similar questions affecting their businesses and we needed to provide them with the right data to help answer them.</p>

	<p>Our high-level objectives were to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Provide value to our customers</b> by providing data-driven insights to help business and HR leaders make key business decisions.</li>
		<li><b>Decrease or eliminate related support time</b> our teams were spending creating custom reports.</li>
		<li>Design the feature to account for growing organization structures to <b>increase scalability</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Finding the right balance</h2>

	<p>We interviewed 10 existing customers in various industries to understand what kind of metrics they were tracking–if any, and which were the most important to the success of their organization. We discovered that larger customers were diligent about tracking metrics and had multiple spreadsheets on hand to share with us. But many of the smaller businesses others weren’t doing any kind of reporting at all.	</p>

	<p>It became clear that we had users at both ends of the spectrum so I needed to design something that was customizable enough to appeal to power users, but also simple enough for those just trying to answer the question, “Are we doing this right?”

	We now knew what questions our users were asking from our research and I hypothesized that we could tell them a story with their data that would help them make better hiring decisions.</p>

	<h2>So what?</h2>

	<p>I was thrilled that we had figured out the right questions to ask. We started with three important ones to stay within a small scope. They were:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>How efficiently are people moving through my hiring process?</li>
		<li>How well am I actually following my hiring process?</li>
		<li>What is my best source of applicants?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The next step was to try and find the best way to tell these stories to our users, but something kept nagging at me. So what if 80% of my hires completed all hiring steps? So what if I only viewed 74% of my applicants? So what if Indeed gave me the highest number of candidates?

	If our users didn’t have any context into what those metrics meant then I was sure they wouldn’t see any value in the feature. We needed to answer “So what?” and provide actionable next steps to help them improve.</p>

	<p>We took all of our hiring data and were able to create benchmarks based on the customer’s industry to help them understand their metrics and how they compared to others. I also added progress metrics to show how they had improved or worsened from the previous time period and wrote copy to give users an idea of what to do if they were below the industry average.

	We went back to our customers and ran the designs through usability testing. Were we telling the right data stories? And did our users care?</p>

	<p>In testing, there were some points of confusion and design tweaks that needed to be made, but users understood the overall interface. I discovered a big problem though–I had designed the prototypes with placeholder data because I didn’t have access to any real user metrics and it became clear that my numbers were way off from reality.</p>

	<h2>Dumb Data</h2>

	<p>Most of our users became distracted by the off numbers which made testing more challenging. I had requested real data to use from our developers earlier in the project, but it was never made a priority. This was my biggest mistake in the design process. I thought that using dummy numbers would be sufficient enough to show to customers, but it actually left them feeling unsure about the feature and whether or not they could trust it.<p>

	<p>I spoke with my team and stressed how important it was to get actual customer data to work with and they made it happen. I updated the designs based on the new information and continued to test. Once we had real metrics in the prototypes, they told a real story that our customers were able to read back to us. We got feedback, made changes, and started to build.</p>

	<h2>Slow Roll</h2>

	<p>We built this feature very iteratively, releasing small improvements over the remainder of 2017.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>We added a custom date picker option to allow users more control.</li>
		<li>We expanded the process health insight to show which hiring managers were doing a good job adhering to the hiring process–not just those skipping steps.</li>
		<li>We added a whole section in the sourcing insight about sponsored job board returns–which incidentally caused purchases to go down once customers knew the dollar amount they were spending per applicant.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>So there were some unintended consequences, but it meant that users were actually paying attention. We received good feedback and usage was steadily increasing, but I wanted to see if there was another way to get users checking their insights.</p>

	<p>I hypothesized that pushing some metrics in the form of an email report would drive users to the app seeking more information. It would also help showcase product value to secondary users who weren’t in the app every day.</p>

	<h2>The Result</h2>

	<p>Insights was one of our most successful features in 2017 and continues to improve. Our usage goals have been met and we see a nice monthly bump every time the email report goes out.

	However, the biggest result for me has been that our customers have actually been improving their metrics. Since the launch we have had to continually adjust our benchmarks because so many customers have made their hiring processes more efficient. We are helping them save time and actually get better hires in the process.</p>

	<h2>Last thoughts</h2>

	<p>I was extremely intimidated to start this project. I didn’t have a lot of experience with this level of data and I wasn’t sure I was the right person to be designing for it. Luckily, this worked in my favor because I was able to empathize with how most of our users felt about analytics–just tell me what a I need to know and how to make it better.<p>

	<p>This project challenged me and help me grow as a designer. I am so thankful for Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, Edward Tufte, and Stephen Few who all have written amazing books. They gave me the tools to choose the right type of data visualizations that wouldn’t mislead or confuse our users. I also learned the difficult lesson to never start a new design project without real data to work from. How can your design tell the right story if you don’t know any of the plot?</p>
