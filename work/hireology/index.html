<p>Hireology’s reporting section wasn’t providing enough value to our customers and suffered low usage. After our discovery process, we learned that a bloated dashboard of every single metric we track would have the same fate. Our users didn’t care have time to sort through a large quantity of data. They all had similar hiring questions that affected their businesses and we needed to help answer them. </p>
