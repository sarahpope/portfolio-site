    <h3>Product and Content Designer</h3>

    <p class="intro-paragraph">
      I’m a designer working remotely from Cincinnati, OH. I enjoy helping businesses solve tough problems with human-focused solutions.
    </p>

    <p>I have spent most of my adult life captivated by the internet and how we interact with it. Currently, I’m on my third year at Hireology. I work with an amazing team designing software that helps people build better teams. </p>

    <p>I take on freelance projects when I have the bandwidth and I especially enjoy working with clients attempting to do some good in the world. Sound like you? We should talk.</p>

    <p>As a designer, I’m all about implementing what’s best for the end user—not my ego. Solving systemic problems while simultaneously creating something beautiful can feel pretty magical.</p>

    <p>When I’m not working on web, you can find me exploring my new city, herding my two pups, or trying out new hobbies.</p>
